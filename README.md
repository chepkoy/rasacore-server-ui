# Django Rasa Core Server

[Rasa Core](https://core.rasa.ai) uses yaml files to design conversation flow. I wanted a better way to visualize and handle large data sets during bot training and this is where this project comes handy.

## Todo list

- Django admin modelling of NLU training
- Django admin modelling of Rasa core dialog flows i.e stories etc
- Alternate API server to handle requests
- Wrapping of Rasa Core and Rasa NLU to this project
